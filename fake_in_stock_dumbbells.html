 Our latest generation of this product includes our patented quick lock 
technology allowing you to adjust the weight of each dumbbell from 5 to 
75lbs in 2.5 LB increments in less than 15 seconds! The system also 
includes the dumbbell stand.</p><h2>Unparalleled Quality and Realistic Feeling Adjustable Dumbbells</h2><p>Many
 adjustable dumbbells suffer from the same set of problems and 
annoyances. They are cheaply made causing them to break or become 
non-functioning after a short period of time. Not only is this 
expensive, it can also be extremely dangerous. People have reported 
competitors products releasing plates from the dumbbell and causing 
significant injuries. With Ironmaster, you do not have to worry about 
this. Our products are guaranteed for life with a no-frills lifetime 
warranty. Another common complaint of competitor products is that the 
dumbbells do not feel like a real dumbbell. Our adjustable dumbbells 
look, feel, and function just like real dumbbells. They are solid and 
ready to go containing no plastic or fragile components. More 
information about this product is available below in the product details
 section.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="product_meta"><span class="product-stock">Availability: <span class="stock">20</span></span>

 love these things. I have the Power Block Elites as well, and these 
feel 100x better. I even like them better than my Goodlife gym dumb 
bells. They look way better in real life than in pictures. Easily Worth 
the money even if it costed more. Definitely get the 120 set for easier 
change out(especially if you can lift over 80 easily).</p><p>I live In 
Canada so it was a pain to get these. Especially during the pandemic. I 
did a ton of research, and bought these things without ever touching 
them. Pretty sure its the best investment I’ve made. I’m very glad I 
spent the time and money  to get these, they make me excited to work out
 and it has been keeping me in routine 5 days a week.  And they are just
 a beauty to look at, seriously.  Quality is easily 10/10.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="review byuser comment-author-stimpy405 odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-109604"><div id="comment-109604" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/07e7076fbea216b1e1356b8c5404ccd5.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/07e7076fbea216b1e1356b8c5404ccd5?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

1) They feel like a pre-fab dumbbell (I like the powerblocks and 
bowflex, but both of them are a little awkward between the bowflex 
having gaps between plates and the powerblock putting your hand in a 
cage)<br>
2) They extend up to 165lbs<br>
3) There is NO wiggle when locked into place<br>
4) The engineering of having the plates fit into each other before the 
lock screw is in place makes it super quick and easy to shift the weight
 around</p><p>All-in-all to say I’m impressed by these things would be an understatement. I cannot recommend them highly enough!</p></div></div></div></li><li class="review byuser comment-author-joal81 odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-104564"><div id="comment-104564" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/2a00fdbd0426f5d3032aa42ea5cf7ce4.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2a00fdbd0426f5d3032aa42ea5cf7ce4?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 adjustable dumbbells that I have ever used. They lock up real solid 
with absolutely no rattle. I use the time changing the weight as a rest 
interval and then jump right into my next set or exercise. I recommend 
purchasing the 120 lbs add on kit since the 22.5 lb weights are much 
quicker to add than multiple 5 lb plate. Combine these with the 
Ironmaster Quick-Lock Adjustable Kettlebells and a bench and that is all
 you need for a home gym.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="review byuser comment-author-usmc-0341 even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-102504"><div id="comment-102504" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/707d4656e5431e7446fc9da32a1de766.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/707d4656e5431e7446fc9da32a1de766?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 dumbbells are excellent quality and design. They are the correct size 
handle, excellent grip, and it is easy to change weights. I have lifted 
for several years and had a large set of dumbbells in my first garage 
gym. In my new garage gym, I wanted to go with adjustable dumbbells for 
space, but I was concerned about quality, ease of use, and comfort. 
These dumbbells exceeded my expectations and feel excellent for 
performing all exercises. Some adjustable weights are too large (long 
handles) that are awkward and do not feel like dumbbells. Also, unlike 
other adjustable dumbbells, they are comfortable while resting on your 
legs (setup) for doing bench press, shoulder, press, seated curls, etc. 
The included stand is perfect, and I will be purchasing the curl bar 
when back in stock. I am sure like you, I conduct a lot of research 
before buying anything, in particular when it is expensive. These 
dumbbells are worth the cost, and you get what you pay for. I highly 
recommend. I hope this review is helpful.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="review byuser comment-author-paul-106 odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-100287"><div id="comment-100287" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/e8a0b9e0dde0d9b379681aafc2b6d866.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e8a0b9e0dde0d9b379681aafc2b6d866?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

410 lb plate set etc. I have it in my garage and finally built the stand
 that came with it. That stand is solid as a rock and can hold much more
 than this set of dumbells especially where you have space constraints. 
The competition doesn’t even compare to Ironmaster. Need a solid set 
that will last you a lifetime? Go get Ironmaster.<br>
PS.<br>
Their customer service is bar non.<br>
KUDOS to Scott and Matt.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="review byuser comment-author-paxton even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-92517"><div id="comment-92517" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/f267ee3ae6e6c290832b26699d9b65c2.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f267ee3ae6e6c290832b26699d9b65c2?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 spent about a year reading reviews and watching YouTube videos before 
finally buying the adjustable Ironmaster dumbbell set. My biggest 
challenge was justifying spending about double the price of the Bowflex 
or Powerblock adjustable dumbbells. At the end of the day all the 
reviews showed that those brands had a lot of plastic parts which easily
 broke, compared to the Ironmaster which are made 100pct steel.</p><p>Over
 a year in and these weights really don’t take that long to add/remove 
weights. You need a mini break between sets anyway so it’s not as 
annoying as I thought it’d be.</p><p>Secondly, the quality of what 
you’re buying is really why you’re paying more than Bowflex and 
Powerblock. The locking system works very smoothly, and doesn’t appear 
as though it’d have any issues in the future. Additionally, I have these
 weights in my basement where the humidity is higher than average, and 
there’s absolutely not sign of rust, so it appears as though the quality
 of the steel used to make them is pretty high.</p><p>Overall these 
weights are definitely worth the additional money over the competition. 
In the long run, you’ll probably spend less money buying one good 
quality dumbbell set instead of buying several cheap pairs.</p><p>Thanks Ironmaster and I hope anyone reading this finds my review helpful.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment byuser comment-author-mattdaso even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-61177"><div id="comment-61177" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/94552c5c8eb7a877cbd44b51386621f7.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/94552c5c8eb7a877cbd44b51386621f7?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 just opened my packages and I have to say these dumbbells exceeded my 
expectations.  The quality is better than anything I have ever seen.   
Right after my purchase I felt a little buyer’s remorse because they are
 a little pricey.  But after putting everything together and getting 
them in hand I have to say any remorse I had disappeared.  I can’t 
stress the quality enough; and if that wasn’t enough, these dumbbells 
come with a lifetime warranty!!</p><p>On another positive.  The 
Ironmaster customer service is INCREDIBLE.  So after opening all my 
packages and putting everything together I noticed that I was missing 
one five pound plate.  I immediately called customer service and spoke 
with Matt.  Just like that I had the five pound plate on it’s way.  Now 
everyone at one point or another will make a mistake, that’s not 
uncommon.  What is uncommon is truly great customer service that stands 
by their obligation of customer satisfaction.  Ironmaster you’ve gained a

 is a solid set of adjustable dumbbells. As others have said, theses

Weight changes are fairly quick and I have no trouble swapping weight 
between sets. Once the twist lock is engaged these have no movement

 service is also great. I had a minor blemish on one of the plates upon

 has a refreshing dedication to quality and customer service.  I’ve been
 saving up for this set and the 120 lb expansion kit, for about a year. 
 I have no regrets — the feel of the grip, balance, and security of 
these dumbbells is amazing.  I was searching for a set of adjustable 
dumbbells (instead of barbells) for my home strength training equipment —
 because I lacked space, and I had children who could potentially injure
 themselves horsing around with a long bar while I was gone.  I also 
prefer the training with dumbbells because they allow me to use more 
natural-feeling form, with less likelihood of injury or unbalanced 
development.  The overwhelmingly positive reviews on these items are not
 misleading.  They were an excellent, durable, choice for my home gym.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-927"><div id="comment-927" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 rarely write reviews but i had to for ironmaster.  It’s the only way to
 go.  These are real, iron weights, just like at the gym.  I bought 
these and some other items and quit the gym.  I looked at the bowflex, 
and the other brand that are rectangular and not only do those look 
weird and feel unwieldy but they are not made to this standard.  
Ironmasters are solid metal and I can’t imagine how to damage them!  
They are what they are intended to be.  Also, they comfortably get up to
 75lbs each without being too long.  The weights can be used on their 
other items as well, like the curling bar.  Additionally the customer 
service was top notch.  the products arrived long before the estimate 
and that’s during the holiday season and when there was an issue, i got 
someone on the phone who instantly fedexed out the part that i needed 
overnight no cost to me.

 was worried about dealing with the loose plates and the extra time to 
change the weight, but it was unwarranted. They feel great in my hands 
and in motion during movements. It has been a pleasant experience 
transitioning to these. The little extra time it takes to change weights
 has not bothered me at all and with the stand, the loose plates are 
conveniently stored. I actually thought I would just use these for 
heavier lifts as I have a pair of bowflex adjustable dumbells I’ve used 
for years which are quicker to change. However, I like the feel and size
 (decreases with a decrease in weight unlike bowflex) of the ironmaster 
dumbbells so much better that I use them for everything and don’t use my
 bowflex anymore. For the money, I think the bowflex dumbbells are great
 but if you have the room in your budget, these are worth the step up. I
 started enjoying my dumbbell lifts so much more and made better 
strength gains with these because I didn’t feel like I had to be gentle 
with them and their proportionally compact size helps with having better
 form. As a result, I just purchased the add-on plates to take each 
dumbbell up to 120lb. I’m very happy with my purchases and how they have
 enhanced workouts.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment byuser comment-author-nirvana4evr271969 even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-306"><div id="comment-306" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/db9c9d44c4aa2134d9dba359734fc4b2.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/db9c9d44c4aa2134d9dba359734fc4b2?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

compact of the three. I really wish these were on display at big box

<span class="woocommerce-review__dash">–</span> <time class="woocommerce-review__published-date" datetime="2016-08-19T00:00:00-07:00">August 19, 2016</time></p><div class="description"><p><strong>Better Choice Than Fixed Weight Dumbbell Set or Other Adjustable Dumbbell Brands</strong><br>When
 I first began planning out my home gym, having quality dumbbells was at
 the top of my list.  I actually was dead set on purchasing a set of 
fixed dumbbells and was willing (although certainly not pleased) to 
spend the thousands of dollars necessary to do so.  I knew that 
adjustable dumbbells existed but I had never used any.  The only brand I
 was really aware of were the PowerBlock Elite Set Dumbell, 50-Pound 
(pair) but I detested the look of them.  I wanted the feel and look of 
dumbbells that I would find at the gym and they definitely were not it. 
 The only option, I felt at the time, were fixed weight dumbbells. 
Fortunately, I did my due diligence researching different dumbbells and 
gym equipment suppliers before pulling the trigger.  During my research,
 I happened upon the IronMaster Dumbbells and saw they were very 
well-reviewed.  Despite this, I was still set on purchasing fixed weight
 dumbbells.  It wasn’t until I began giving due consideration to the 
space I would have available in my basement gym after putting in a set 
of 5-100 lb dumbbells and the requisite dumbbell racks that I came back 
to Ironmaster.  Then as I considered the other equipment I planned on 
getting, such as the excellent Inspire Fitness Ft2 Functional Trainer 
and Smith Station (Inspire FT2 (with Bench)) , it really sunk in that 
the price of fixed weight dumbbells were just not practical for home 
use. The IronMaster Dumbbells were the perfect solution.  They feel just
 like regular dumbbells you will find at the gym but take up precious 
little space and are vastly more affordable than a fixed set of 
dumbbells with comparable weight range and increments.  I am very 
pleased with my purchase.  The weight change mechanism is very simple 
and I have no concerns about any of the weight plates becoming 
unattached while I am using them. The reason I gave them 4 stars rather 
than 5 is because locking and unlocking the screws is not always as 
simple as IronMaster would have you believe.  Sometimes I have to work 
rather hard to get them locked into place.  Unlocking them, at times, is
 even more difficult.  I think this may have more to do with “technique”
 and I should note that the past few times I have used them, I have not 
had much of a problem.  It may just be something you learn to do better 
with time.  Nevertheless, I felt it was worth pointing out that it can 
be a bit challenging and for a brief period, I was thinking that maybe I
 would have to purchase a different brand of adjustable dumbbell.  But 
again, this has been less of an issue recently and once the weights are 
locked in place, these things feel awesome.  I strongly recommend the 
IronMaster dumbbells.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-932"><div id="comment-932" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 One of the best features about these is that it has the flat ends so

rods of traditional adjustable dumbells. The materials are definitely 
high quality with no shaking of weights whatsoever. The stand is also a 
great addition to keeping my lifting area clean and its compact enough 
to take up about the same amount of space if i were to put these weights
 on the ground side by side. My only two complaint with these would be 
that the stand it ever so slightly too small. Its not that big of a deal
 but i wish i would be able to attach/detach weights from all sides of 
the stand. Not really that big of an issue. And the price but in all

 Ironmaster Dumbells are by far the best adjustable dumbells I’ve seen. 
The old adjustable dumbells of yesteryear are much cheaper but 
essentially look like mini-barbells. They’ll always stay the same length
 and they have pointy ends which make resting the ends on your legs near
 impractical. Bowflex has a fairly large always-length as well, and you 
can’t customize the weight too much (they miss some increments in their 
range) and are fairly awkward looking in certain weight configurations. 
The powerblocks at least are space efficient as they grow in size only 
with increased weight. But they are very awkward to hold and do not look
 like real dumbells. Enter the Ironmasters, which IMO fix every issue 
with all of the aformentioned dumbell sets. They look like (close 
enough) real dumbells, support ALL 2.5 weight increments between 5 and 
75 pounds, are space efficient as they grow consistently in size with 
increased weight, they change in weight quickly, and they are beautiful.
 Super high quality iron and steel construction. The round ends are 
shiny and the inners are clean shiny knurled handles, with ample width 
to hold for any equivalent fixed-dumbell exercise. Regarding the speed 
of weight adjusting. The speed you can change the weight is really up to
 the user. Ironmaster has implemented a very simple technique for 
locking and unlocking the ends. It takes about a half turn each way to 
lock/unlock them. The stand is set up specifically to be very functional
 for weight adjusting. The stand is long enough so you can pull out the 
ends and rest them on platform. The weights are stored in sections on 
either side of the stand for quick access to additional plates. The 
plates are shaped to interlock into each other so you can push them 
together without having to hold them together with your other hand. I 
would say with a little learning curve, you can do a full weight change 
of both dumbells in about 12 – 15 seconds. Given all of the design 
choices mentioned above, you can change each end of a dumbell 
simultaneously. The stand isn’t super attractive, but it is very 
functional. Stands like the Bowflex look “cooler” and have a more 
minimal design. That being said, the stand looks high quality and color 
matches the weights. As a bonus, the top platform is ribbed and 
rubberized which both allows the weights to land softly as well as give 
it a cool aesthetic note. The design of the stand really shines when you
 realize how easy it makes to store and change out the weights. You are 
after all, storing 60 pounds of weight plates on each side of the stand.
 The weights set is one of the most expensive around, but IMO it is 
definitely worth it. Owning this set will leave little to be desired 
from cheaper sets, and in the end will probably last you longer both for
 less reason to try out other sets, and in its all-metal durability.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-943"><div id="comment-943" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="4">

 solid construction and compact, but calling these “”quick lock”” and 
comparing them to the other adjustable dumbbells on the market isn’t 
really accurate. These are quicker than spinlocks and as nearly as solid
 as commercial dumbbells, but take around 60 seconds to adjust the 
weight on both dumbbells compared to 10 seconds or less with other 
brands. What you get with these is a piece of equipment that you can 
load up to 165lbs on and then throw out a second story window without 
breaking anything (watch the torture tests). Personally, I think the 
only real advantage these have over spinlocks is they have a flat base 
for resting the weights on your thighs when doing press exercises.</p><p>The
 quick lock system does not work as advertised; it is not just a quarter
 turn to lock them into place. It usually takes anywhere from 3/4 to 2 
turns to lock the weights in place. On one of my dumbbells, I have to 
back the screw out about an 1/8 inch and then give it about 2 or 3 turns
 to lock it into place. This is the reason for my 4 star rating, other 
than that it’s a top quality product – but I prefer Powerblocks for my 
home gym.”</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-944"><div id="comment-944" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 ordered the quick-lock adjustable dumbbells with a ironmaster’s bench, 
pull up bar, dip bar and crunch sit-up attachment over 8 years ago. I 
would HIGHLY recommend the Ironmaster to anyone looking for a great 
weight lifting solution when you have limited space. In fact, I would 
recommend it for anyone that has a home gym regardless of space (I 
ordered it originally because I only had a small room to workout. I have
 since built a complete home gym and the ironmaster remains is an 
integral part). I use it for all of my upper body exercises. I have 
never had a problem with any of the equipment. It is well built and 
durable (though I do not drop the weights). It’s fast and easy to 
add/reduce weight (one of my initial concerns when I first bought it). I
 use the full range of weights all the way up to the full 75lbs per 
dumbbell and it works the same across the specturm. To me, this is a 
no-brainer given the price point. Even at a much higher price, it would 
still be worth the money!</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment byuser comment-author-dbswartz1974 odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-285"><div id="comment-285" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/e1794edb0b1544af216c3055f6b32d4a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e1794edb0b1544af216c3055f6b32d4a?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 The weights lock into place securely and remain solid and tight

 in the habit of double checking between sets. On a rare occasion I may 
have to slightly tighten one or two locking screws. The smooth face of 
the locking screw is comfortable when resting the weights on my 
thighs..no painful bars digging into my legs! Yes these are not a fast 
to change as some other systems, but I have found that if I plan ahead 
and set out the extra plates I need, I can make the change in 10-15 
seconds per weight.. Plenty fast enough for me. The stand is very solid 
and goes together easily. Instructions are pretty rudimentary but it is 
easy to figure out and assemble.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-942"><div id="comment-942" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="4">

They’re great for versatility and you can change the weight on them

is FLAT. Most folks will sit on the bench a minute to get 
pumped/concentrate before they actually lay down and start 
lifting….during this time they will set the weights on their upper 
thighs. On some of the other weight sets, this is not possible due to 
the end of the weights not being flat. This may seem small, but it 
mattered to me.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-950"><div id="comment-950" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 far the best adjustable Dumbbells on the market.  These are the real 
deal.  Yes you are going to pay the most for ironmaster, but you get 
what you pay for…and that is quality.  They are worth it because they 
will last a lifetime, not to mention the performance is unmatched by the
 other adjustable Dumbbells on the market today. When I was looking to 
buy a set, I definitely did my research.  I have tried out the bowflex 
and the problem I have with them is they just don’t feel like they’re 
built strong and tough.  I also don’t really trust the locking devise, 
especially when lifting heavier around 80-over 100lbs.  They just don’t 
give you the peace of mind that the iron masters do of being locked in, 
no doubt about it.  The main thing I didn’t like about the power blocks 
is again when lifting heavier, it is unsettling to have your hands and 
wrists locked into the Dumbbells just in case you were to fail on your 
last rep and had to drop them.  Bottom line,  you will pay less and a 
lot less for the other brands/types, but you won’t get the quality and 
peace of mind that you will get with the ironmasters.  Remember that 
weights are an investment and if you buy the right set, you will own 
them a long time…it’s worth it!</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment byuser comment-author-pitsnipe11999 even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-267"><div id="comment-267" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/985f31258e288c40fec70baed8abe12e.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/985f31258e288c40fec70baed8abe12e?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 like dumbbells that are solid, simple, and reliable, and I know of no 
better adjustable dumbbell that fits the bill than Ironmaster 
Quick-Locks. Ideally, I’d like a room filled with hex or pro-style 
dumbbells. But I don’t have the room nor do I want to spend that type of
 money. If you want an adjustable dumbbell that’s a very close 
alternative to a fixed dumbbell, without spending a fortune or taking up
 an entire room with wall-to-wall bells, then Ironmaster is the clear 
choice.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment byuser comment-author-chris-163 odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-248"><div id="comment-248" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/b10016527cb431e44a13c6f8e7051edc.png" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b10016527cb431e44a13c6f8e7051edc?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 moons ago I was introduced to Ironmaster dumbbells by my friend, Tim 
Carr. Little did I know it when we first met, but Tim had been very sick
 his entire life. Despite being unable to breathe properly a good deal 
of the day, every day, Tim always maintained perspective. Not only that,
 he pursued his passion, which was lifting weights. He was one of the 
most amazing human beings I’ve ever met. This review is in memory of 
him.</p><p>Let me preface this review by saying that nothing can really 
ever take the place of hex, pro-style, or a set of fixed weight 
dumbbells. But, if you’re like me, and you lack room for or don’t want 
to spend a small fortune on an enitre set of dumbbells in 5lb. 
increments, Ironmaster dumbbells are the way to go. I’ll tell you why I 
think Ironmasters are among the best dumbbells on the market.</p><p>First,
 my favorite feel in a dumbbell is what you’d find in a fixed dumbbell, 
like a hex or pro-style dumbbell. Solid and reliable. Without doubt, the
 closest you’ll come to this type of feel is Ironmaster dumbbells. It’s 
true, you do have to fiddle with weight plates, but once they are locked
 down it’s like the entire dumbbell is one uniform hunk of steel. It’s 
amazing how solid these dumbbells truly are.</p><p>Second, I really like
 the locking screws that holster the plates into the dumbbell handle. 
With one quarter turn of the screw, the plates are safely locked in 
place.</p><p>Third, Ironmaster dumbbells, unlike some of their 
competitors, comes with a very nice stand. You can put everything on 
this stand, including your dumbbell handles and weight plates (and your 
120lb add-on kit, if you choose to go that route). The stand is 
functional and intuitive, is a nice dark gray color, and looks great in 
any setting.</p><p>Fourth, Ironmaster dumbbells really are aesthetically
 beautiful dumbbells. The chrome finished handles and locking screws in 
combination with the textured powder coated weight plates make for an 
extremely attractive addition to one’s weight room. They are sleek and 
elegant, very functional, yet classical in orientation.</p><p>Fifth, 
Ironmaster has perfected the weight of these dumbbells. In other words, 
when I stack four 5lb. plates onto the dumbbell handle, the weight is 
almost a perfect 30lbs. The foundry producing the weight plates and 
handles have obviously perfected the process, with the end result being a
 dumbbell that is true to weight.</p><p>Finally, I love the knurled grips.</p><p>Ironmaster
 dumbbells are as solid as the day is long. If you are looking for an 
amazing set of dumbbells, that provide room for you to grow, these are 
the obvious choice. You can expand to 120lbs. and 165lbs. You can also 
use the dumbbell weight plates for Ironmaster’s amazing kettlebells, as 
well. That’s another item in my purchasing future, no doubt. The only 
drawback I can think of for these dumbbells is the amount of time it 
takes to change the weight plates. The locking screws are a definite 
improvement on the old spinlock design, but if you are expecting rapid 
weight change with these bells, then you will be disappointed. It takes 
me around 25 seconds to change weights on both dumbbells (excluding 120 
add-on plates), but the solid design in combination with all of the 
other great things about this dumbbell more than make up for how long it
 takes to change plates. Also, the longer you change plates on this 
dumbbell, the better you get.</p><p>Recommended!</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment byuser comment-author-daniel-226 odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-239"><div id="comment-239" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/c4b9d63db49adec00272a25a786d73f0.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c4b9d63db49adec00272a25a786d73f0?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 got my Ironmaster 2x 75lb set two days ago.  Though I haven’t had them 
long I’ve been playing with then all weekend and am extremely impressed.
  They are ridiculously solid.  I was between these and the powerblocks 
and opted for these because they feel more like traditional Dumbbells.  
I’m used to Hex shaped Dumbbells but I’ve never had a full set and got 
tired of working with an odd selection of weights.  These are similar to
 the shape I’m used to while staying just as rock solid as fixed 
Dumbbells.  I’ve never felt comfortable with spinlocks, the overhang on 
the handles makes it awkward for me.  These stay pretty much the same 
shape when adding/removing weight which allows you to get comfortable 
with them quickly.  The only real adjustment was getting used to the 
wider grip handles (have pretty big hands as well).  The wider than 
normal diameter of the handles could possibly be a pain for someone with
 small hands. These don’t change weights lightning fast like the 
powerblocks can, so don’t expect that.  You can however become pretty 
fast at swapping them out.  I didn’t read any of the instructions for 
the Dumbbells managed to completely have the process mastered in just a 
few minutes.  They must have fixed/corrected the weight issues other 
customers had complained about (light weights).  I noticed when holding 
this set at 40 and a 40lb hex dumbbell this weighed significantly more. 
 I took the plates off and weighed them and I’m getting 5.2lbs for the 
5lb plates and 2.6-2.7lbs on the 2.5lb plates (It also turns out my hex 
dumbbell only weighs about 36lbs!).  Great value buy considering that 
just buying sets of 60-75lb Dumbbells would cost you more. My only 
complaint is more of a question than complaint.  Why don’t you guys make
 1.25lb weight plates for these!?  Sure you can adjust in 2.5lb 
increments by adding only one 2.5 plate (instead of two) and altering 
your grip.  Why not just include 1.25 pound plates as well for maximum 
customization?  That would make an already amazing product absolutely 
perfect.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-957"><div id="comment-957" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 set of dumbells is great. They’re very sturdy with virtually no risk of
 falling apart during your movement or if you drop them after a heavy

 you can slide it all the way in before turning it to lock. They take up
 very little space and will last a lifetime unlike other adjustable 
dumbells which have moving parts inside made of plastic. This product is
 solid iron. It’s also flat at the end which is important when working

footprint, and are durable enough for everyday use. One thing I am 
unsure about is the small platform to put the DBs on after using the 
add-on kit. If you load your DBs up pretty heavy and then go to put them
 back on the stand you have to be careful and focused. The ironmaster 
dumbbells will also never be as convenient as have a full set of 
dumbbells at your disposal. Forget the hyper quick grab and go or rapid 
drop set procedure, not going to happen no matter how quickly you can 
change the weight plates. There is always going to be that time in 
between sets where you’re changing plates, etc…but some might use that 
as a proper rest period. For me this process has actually been pretty 
therapeutic and helped me to separate sets uniformly as it relates to 
time. I would buy these again given their price, build quality, and ease
 of use.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-963"><div id="comment-963" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 wife and I have been using these dumbbells for over a year now. We keep
 them around for when our schedules don’t allow time for the gym. The 
fit and finish is great, and changing them around is a snap with the 
screw in couplers. The shape of the DB is such that you can do all the 
normal exercises with them, plus some of the more dynamic ones like 
Turkish getups, one arm DB snatch, etc. My buddy has the Bowflex DB set,
 and those are far bulkier. Plus, being that these are all metal, there 
are very few fatigue points. The Bowflex DB set has some sort of plastic
 latch that holds the plates to the DB handle, and those do break if you
 accidentally drop one. We broke both of our Bowflex DB sets in Iraq.</p><p>The
 stand is handsome and sturdy. It also provides storage for all of the 
plates. This thing has been a huge boon on days that we cannot get to 
the gym. I would tell you to buy them in a second. The overall kit is 
very heavy though, so be aware of that when it arrives.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-969"><div id="comment-969" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 used PowerBlocks and Bowflex SelectTech 552’s.  I found the Bowflex too
 fragile, and the PowerBlocks uncomfortable.  These are the best of the 
three by FAR.  These are simple, reliable, durable, and have the solid 
feel of commercial gym equipment.  I like “regular” gym-style dumbbells,
 I just wish they were adjustable.  IronMaster achieves this without 
altering the basic idea.  What more can be said?  I wasn’t sure how I’d 
feel about square weights, but this turns out to be a huge improvement. 
 They’re compact, stackable, and don’t roll away.  I have no use for the
 stand, so haven’t bothered to assemble it, but it also appears to be 
well-made. I went straight to IronMaster and got a better deal than is 
listed here.  IronMaster is a small, family-run business, selling their 
own designs with minimal overhead.  It’s hard to avoid the impression 
that they are gymrats themselves, and influenced by Arnold’s philosophy 
that gyms should be simple and functional.  My dumbbells shipped in 
no-frills packaging with a simple QuickBooks invoice.  No infomercials, 
no workout DVD’s, or false promises.  I can tell my money went into the 
product itself and I can’t remember being happier with a purchase.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-971"><div id="comment-971" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 cannot praise the Ironmaster adjustable dumbbell set and stand highly 
enough. It was actually a Christmas present–and the best present I ever 
received! The set comes with two adjustable dumbbells (75 pounds each) 
along with a very smart-looking and space saving stand. There is an 
optional add-on kit that enables each dumbbell to 125 lbs that I am 
considering purchasing. I view it as a fantastic convenience for 
individuals with greater strength who take their workouts seriously. The
 best feature of this dumbbell set in my opinion is stability. Another 
reviewer commented that these dumbbells are easier to handle and are 
more ‘stable’ than professional or standard weight-room dumbbells, and I
 concur with this opinion. I attribute this to their square shape, which
 allows them a greater range of motion; i.e-the ends can be held palms 
up, between the knees, feet, etc, for a wide variety of traditional and 
untraditional movements. The square shape also allows the dumbbells to 
be picked up or placed on the ground more easily. The wide, 
flat-head-quick-lock pins really do their job of locking the weight 
plates into position. When I hoist the dumbells above my head, I never 
worry about the plates moving or the pins becoming disengaged. There is 
no rattling or moving of the plates while they are in use. I cannot say 
this about any other adjustable dumbbell set I have used—and I have used
 them all. The Ironmaster Dumbbell set is also a great-looking product. 
Who knew dumbbells could be so sexy? The only criticism I can think to 
mention is the length of time it takes to change weight plates on the 
individual dumbbells. The PowerBlocks and Bowflex/Nautilus adjustable 
dumbbells allow any user to change weight faster, but suffer in other 
categories when compared to the Ironmaster product. I can add or 
subtract any amount of weight on both of my Ironmaster dumbells in under
 60 seconds. For most people, this is probably a non-issue but It may be
 something to think about if you use lighter weights and go from set to 
set with no rest in between(we used to call this ‘super-setting’ back in
 the day). To summarize, I found these Ironmaster products to be sturdy,
 stable, balanced, and very well made. The price might be a little 
steep, but it is well worth the investment if you take physical fitness 
and weight training seriously.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-973"><div id="comment-973" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 THIS is the set I’ve been looking for.  After months of researching the
 Bowflex (and testing it, my brother has the 552 and 4.1 bench) and 
PowerBlock, I could never make up my mind.  I stumbled upon the 
Ironmasters on a forum, researched it for a few hours (check out the 
YouTube videos) and was sold. The Bowflex’s are long and seem fragile. I
 had a friend use them rigorously and after a while, the dials were 
difficult to adjust.  I didn’t like how one set goes up to 52.5 pounds 
and the other goes up to 95.  How will you break the plateau…oh, by 
buying another set! PowerBlock weirded me out with the “cage” style and 
those bars hovering around your wrists. It made me feel unsafe, although
 I’ve read tons of good things otherwise. The only plus that Bowflex and
 PowerBlock have over the Ironmasters is the SPEED in changing the 
weights.  It seemed contradictory to me, if I need speed, I may need to 
toss my weights around, yet the Bowflex’s don’t lend themselves well to 
being roughed. Either way, understand your use case to determine if 
these are right for you. For me, I used to be a gym rat, and mainly used
 dumbbells for my workouts.  I knew I wanted as authentic a feel as that
 in a commercial gym.  These definitely feel commercial grade in terms 
of quality and durability.  Now that I have a kid and a job, I can do 
quick sets in the morning and when I get home from work.  The quick lock
 mechanism seems simple enough that I can be rough (although I try not 
to be, but if you go heavy, you may drop or be a little rougher from 
time to time). Last bit of advice, check the Ironmasters website. For 
me, buying direct was $30 cheaper than Amazon at the time. I ended up 
getting a package deal to save on shipping.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-974"><div id="comment-974" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 Best. I bought these directly from ironmaster about 4 years ago. It 
gets used almost everyday of the week amongst my two teenage boys and 
myself. No issues like rattling, pin not locking or anything mechanical 
which prevents us from abusing these. The paint from the weight plates 
have chipped but that is of no importance to us. I have intentionally 
used the word abused as they have been dropped several times on the 
carpeted floor from a height of one to two feet without any negative 
consequences. Now the pros: rock solid, no awkward shape, well balanced 
and relatively easy to change weights (weight change becomes easier and 
faster as you keep on doing it) Cons: You may find it slower and a 
little more cumbersome to change weight if you are doing circuit 
training and like to change weights several times in your whatever 
routine in less than a minute. I have considered buying bowflex 
dumbbells to complement these dumbbells when I am doing circuit training
 but after getting used to its feel and getting faster in changing 
weights, I dropped that idea. My boys and I routinely test other brands 
of adjustable dumbbells when we are at any sporting shop but we have yet
 not been sold on anything else. If you get a chance just hold it and 
see how it feels then compare with other adjustable dumbbells out there.
 In my humble opinion, if you have space and means then this is the 
first dumbbell set which is a must have that can be complemented later 
by bowflex select tech 52.5 for circuit training. In our situation we 
are limited for space as we have a treadmill, power tower, a huge hoist 
free weights half cage with smith machine, leg attachments and these 
dumbbells in our basement exercise room. Happy strength training!</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-976"><div id="comment-976" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 typing this on my phone so I apologize in advance for typos. I don’t 
have a lot of space in my garage to work out with, so I wanted a pair of
 adjustable dumbells where I could work out my entire upper body with, 
not just arms and chest. I narrowed my list down to three options: 
convenient Bowflex Selecttech series, Iron Master dumbells which were 
heavily recommended but I didn’t care for, or traditional cheap spin 
lock dumbells. Here is my initial analysis with each option. Bowflex 
Selecttech Initially I was favoring the Bowflex Select tech adjustable 
dumbells for the versatility and convenience. I took previous reviewers 
take on those dumbells with a grain of salt and eventually took one 
posters advice and tried them out in the store. One dumbell was broken 
and it couldn’t take it out of the stand. The other was fun to use 
admittedly, but extremely bulky even at lower weights. I read a lot of 
reviews about how they break easy. Easy to break + bulky + $600 = me a 
little worried. Ironmaster quicklock dumbells Highly recommended by most
 reviewers, comes with lifetime warranty plus good quality, made this 
hard to ignore. The quicklock aspect seemed like a gimmick to me and 
they seemed overpriced. Expensive + still have to change weights = 
overpriced Traditional spinlock dumbells I could get 40 lbs more weight 
for about 1/3 the cost of the ironmasters or bowflex dumbells.  Best 
option right? Well for me, I have had spin lock dumbells and hate 
changing the weights. Plus I like to kick the weights up with my legs 
when doing chest exercises which I can’t do with big screw-like ends 
sticking out. Screw-end sticking out + hassle changing weights = last 
case scenario Verdict I decided on the Ironmasters for the quality, 
“quick” weight changing, durability, and life-time guarantee. Let me 
tell you, best decision ever. Better than advertised. I have been using 
them for 3 months and love them. I’m thinking of buying a lot more 
products from ironmaster once I get more space in my garage. Let me put 
to rest any concerns you have. 1. Price Good quality. Dropped them 
several times, bang them together during work outs, work out with 3 
other people abusing them, no problems at all. Backed by lifetime 
warranty and well worth the cost. 2. Still have to change weights The 
more you change these, the faster you get. I change weights just by 
myself at least 7 times per workout. Mix that in with 3 more people 
doing 7 exercises each alternating every set, and it has yet to be a 
hassle.  I wouldn’t say these are so much quick changing dumbells 
compared to power block and bowflex, although they are fast, but they 
are more or less HASSLE-FREE spin lock dumbells. 3. Bulkiness These are 
roughly the same size as dumbells in the gym. The square shape is a bit 
unconventional but haven’t interfered with any workouts or been a factor
 at all. 4. Cheap stand First off, it comes with a stand which is great 
in itself. The stand does feel a bit flimsy but it’s not. Plenty of 
storage for all the weights. Only gripe is I wish it was a bit longer 
for changing weights, but not a big issue. These are a great purchase 
and if you want reliable weights for moderate to heavy lifting, these 
are the weights for you.  Seriously, unless u need instant weight 
changes, these are the best option.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-980"><div id="comment-980" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 I had the Bowflex adjustable dumbbells that go up to 50 or 55 pounds. I
 forgot which it was. I has them for a couple years and they were 
serving me well until on day I had placed one of them on my bench and 
left to get the door. I guess I didn’t position it on the bench well and
 it fell. As soon as I picked it up I saw a plastic piece of the dumbell
 had broke on the inside. Because of that it wouldn’t lock onto any more
 plates on the stand. I was furious because I love how quickly you could
 switch back and forth between weight. What I didn’t like was how wide 
and bulky it was. A year or 2 later, I was walking in a Costco and came 
upon a pair of iron adjustable dumbbells. It looked kind of like the 
Bowflex ones but all iron. It cost me 500 or so dollars. I brought them 
home and was pleased with them. Only, sometimes when you go to pick them
 up off the stand, a plate may stick on either side so you have to shake
 it a bit to let it drop. Small inconvinece if you ask me. It was just 
as wide as the Bowflex dumbells also, so i was used to it. I still have 
them to this day and will never sell them. But, last year, I saw an 
advertisement for these online and loved how nothing on it was plastic 
and it seemed more stable and reliable then any I’ve bought so far. I 
bought them through the ironmaster website since I never knew amazon 
sold them. Worth every penny! I never have to be scared about a plate 
falling on my head since the friction lock holds up very well. It isn’t 
as fast a switch from weight to weight but honestly, for the stability I
 gained by losing a little speed? Who cares. I have dropped it multiple 
times and it holds up. Even broke pieces of my floor and the dumbells 
stayed intact. Still locked, ready to go another round. Since then I 
have went on to purchase the bench and attachments to it. Built a pretty
 good home gym out of it. The ironmaster site has all these things 
together as packages discounted so I went there to do it. But for the 
purposes of this post, top of the line dumbells!</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-981"><div id="comment-981" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 have both adjustable dumbbells at home, with my purchase of the 
Ironmaster being for lifts like overhead triceps extensions and dumbbell
 pullovers that were difficult with the bulkier Powerblock design. 
Because of the design of the locking mechanism with the Ironmaster, 
there are fewer overlapping threads at higher weights, making it less 
secure at 75 lbs. Despite my cranking as hard as humanly possible, the 
dumbbell came apart while I was mid-lift, resulting in me cutting up 
both my forearms pretty badly. The plates barely missed my toes when 
they fell. I ordered a second set of pins for the weight extension, 
thinking that with longer threads there would be a more secure fit. They
 were slightly imrpoved, though because of their length they were 
cumbersome to switch out, making it difficult or impossible to maintain 
specific rest intervals for quicker sets, and they cannot be used at 
lower weight ranges. Also, their locking mechanism was still not as snug
 or reassuring as the Powerblocks. The entire collection is now 
gathering dust in the corner of my room, 200 lbs of paperweights. Novel 
design, but unfortunately a dangerous Achilles heel at the high end of 
the weight spectrum. Longer threads on the locking mechanisms would 
help, or a simple magnetic clasp or pin. I have had the Powerblocks for 
quite some time, and although they are slightly bulkier and more 
awkward, the magnetic pins have consistently held up, even when in the 
heavier range. *Update* After 2 years, the problem with insecure fitting
 of the locking mechanism has only worsened. I now rarely use the 
dumbbells, favoring the Powerblock almost entirely. When I need 
something less bulky, I have bought individual dumbbells gradually over 
time. For those that require the entire weight spectrum, this would be 
more expensive than the IronMaster, but it is cheaper for me as I also 
use the Powerblock. And it is certainly cheaper than a hospital bill for
 a broken toe, or stitches for a forearm laceration. This continued 
frustration has endorsed my earlier concerns about this product. I would
 advise my fellow Amazoners to avoid the Ironmaster. Great concept in 
theory, flawed in execution.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-983"><div id="comment-983" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 bought these a little less than a year ago and at first they were 
wonderful, but soon after the locking mechanism would not tighten. As 
advertised, I dropped them on occasion when lifting heavy and this 
caused a chip on the serrated part of the locking mechanism.  so I had 
to buy another one from the manufacturer. Great customer service on 
their end. Months later the same thing happened and won’t tighten again.
 I’d rather buy individual dumbbells as it’s quicker and easier. Plus 
you don’t have to worry about the weights dropping on your head due to a
 faulty locking mechanism. If you you refrain from dropping weights, 
this is a good product for you. Probably why I will never be invited to

 replace a pair of Bowflex Selecttech 552″s (version 1)  which suffered 
from the usual broken tabs with weights falling out and locking of the 
dial in the handle.  although my wife bought them for me several years 
ago, I didn’t open them up and start using them untill about 3 years 
ago.  Too many moving parts for the Selectech model to last for many 
years.  Every time I lifted the 552’s from the stand I was consciously 
aware and nervous that they sere going to fall on my feet.  When doing 
chest and military dumbbell presses I was always concerned they would 
fall on my head.  They never did but it often affected my concentration 
during the lifts.  The rattling of the weights doesn’t ease one’s 
concern.  Finally, they did start to fall from the holder when lifting 
from the stand- tabs broken.  Subsequently, the dials started to lock up
 on one of the handles. I bring this up because I considered buying the 
version 2 Bowflex Selecttechs but because of the above concerns about 
reliability, lack of longevity, and the constant concern that the 
weights would come loose, I decided against giving Bowflex more of my 
business.  I did a lot a research, especially on the 
weightlifting/bodybuilding forums.  I would say the Ironmaster seems to 
be the top-recommended one with Powerblocks being a close second.  Each 
person has their preferences.  I have used Powerblocks and they give a 
lot of bang for the buck but I didn’t feel comfortable having my hand 
and wrist  enclosed in the cage and, like Selecttechs, they rattle quite
 a bit.  Again, this is probably psychological- a worry more than a real
 threat.  But you shouldn’t have that concern nor should you have your 
concentration interrupted during a set because of it.  However, I do 
realize that many people might not care about the rattling and other 
concerns that I had. I just received my Ironmasters a few days ago and 
used them twice.  They are awesome, though expensive.  No rattling- they
 are rock solid and easy to change.  Not quite as fast as Selecttech- it
 takes me about 40 seconds (timed) to comfortably change both dumbbells.
  With more use I believe I will likely be able to casually do it in 
even less time. I feel that Ironmasters can be looked at as more of an 
“investment.”  After 10 years of use, I doubt many people will have 
functioning Selecttechs, based on my own experience and what I have 
read, even with some improvements in Selecttech version 2 db’s.  
However, Ironmaster has no moving parts except for the locking pins 
which are SOLID.  These should last a lifetime.  I have no doubt I will 
be able to sell these on CL in 10 or 15 years for close to or above what
 I paid for them (adjusting for inflation).  There is little reason for 
the Ironmasters to depreciate.  Iron and steel.  However, I would be 
quite hesitant to buy used plastic Selecttechs.  Just MHO.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-989"><div id="comment-989" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 have the powerblock elite 90lbs, the Powerblock U-50s and the 120lb 
ironmaster dumbbells. I use ironmasters for my heavier sets and drop set
 with powerblocks. Awesome combination! Powerblocks : Very quick and 
almost no effort to change amount of weight which is soo convenient. Not
 to mention its color coated so I dont have to spend time counting the 
weights like ironmasters. Build quality, size, durability, distribution 
of weight and balance is very good (ironmasters are better in those 
categories but still top notch).The Urethane ones are a lot more durable
 than elites. These are perfect for circuit training and drop sets. They
 look like dumbbells from the future which I love. Ironmasters : The 
best build quality, size, durability, balance and distribution of weight
 of any adjustable dumbbells. The grip better than powerblock elites, in
 fact these are the best feeling dumbbells I’ve ever held.I actually 
dropped these a couple of times when doing a heavy set of chest presses 
on 3/8 inch thick rubber flooring and wow these thing can take abuse. 
They are absolutly tough! It does takes significantly longer to change 
weight with a lot of effort which powerblocks kills it in that category.
 It is the absolute downside when comparing the 2.They look very 
handsome and look like a mans dumbbell lol. You can also use the plates 
for any standard bar which makes them all the more versatile. I 
absolutely love both. You can’t go wrong with any of them. JUST DON’T 
GET BOWFLEX DUMBBELLS!! They break very easily and are awkwardly long.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-990"><div id="comment-990" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 of all, I have to address the shipping. I received these dumbbells less
 than 48 hours after I ordered them. Admittedly, the company is based in
 Washington state, which is where I live, but even so, 2 days is 
incredibly impressive for shipping, especially for such a cumbersome 
product. As for the weights themselves, I’m extremely happy with them. 
They’re fairly easy to use; after I got used to the mechanism for 
changing the weight, I could adjust both sets in about 30 seconds, 
depending on the amount of weight added or removed. I researched pretty 
extensively before buying these (looking especially at the power block 
and bowflex products), and in the end I chose Ironmaster for the 
simplicity of the design and for the purposed durability. I was not 
disappointed at all in either. This is a solid metal dumbbell with only 
one moving part per side; I’m very confident that if I dropped these off
 my roof, my driveway would suffer more damage than these dumbbells. I’m
 totally positive that I will never need to buy a new set of weights

 these from Ironmaster 5 years back.  They are rock solid.  I’ve dropped
 them on concrete at funny angles and they don’t bend or warp or 
anything (which is more than I can say about the concrete).  I have no 
doubt my grandkids will be able to use these things.  I also bought the 
super-bench with the add-ons and they are rock solid too.  The dip bar 
came with a slashed hand grip so I called and talked to someone to see 
if they could send me a new grip and they sent me a new entire dip bar. 
 I was originally bummed, but ended up being very impressed by their 
customer service.  These are one of those rare products that are 
actually designed to be as good as possible.  I came on here to look at 
their kettlebell handles and decided to finally write a review.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-996"><div id="comment-996" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 problem of traditional dumbbells is the need to have multiple pairs if 
you want to minimize time when changing weight, which takes up space.  
So I started comparing those adjustable type and after doing my research
 and physically comparing them, I settled on the Ironmaster. Unlike most
 other adjustable sets, Ironmaster’s come with a lifetime warranty and 
were adjustable from 5-75lbs as compared to a lot of others with lesser 
weights. The handles are solid steel and weigh 5 lbs and are very well 
made.  They are chrome plated with the knurled steela for better grip 
and are no different than traditional dumbbells. The outsides are 
squared in design with a notch on one of the sides of the square. The 
weights use a locking screw mechanism and made of steel as well.  The 
handles are easily marked with an “OPEN” and “LOCK” to make it easy for 
you to know which direction you need to turn to lock the weights in 
place. The weights are also solid and made of iron, which in comparison 
to other brands that are sometimes plastic or cheaper materials.  The 
locking screws make it easy to change in and out the weights within a 
matter of seconds.  Now in comparison to the click type adjustable 
weights they aren’t maybe as quick but the advantage of the material 
that they are made, makes this a more durable choice.  You can also get 
an add-on kit that will enable you to increase the resistance all the 
way up to 120-lbs per dumbbell. The rack that comes with is very handy 
at storing the weights and assisting in the change of the dumbbells.  I 
do think that ironmaster could have made this storage rack a little more
 solid.  After putting together, it seem to have a bit of a flimsy feel 
to it.  I guess maybe I was expecting a solid build like the dumbbells. 
Although these are pricy in comparison to cheaper sets, I feel that if 
you want a long term solution, this is it.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-998"><div id="comment-998" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 likely you are looking at the Ironmaster(IM) or Powerblock(PB) 
dumbbells. Honestly both work well. Both are great but I believe IM is 
far superior. It feels and moves like a dumbbell while the PB feels 
strange during movement and the weight isn’t distributed like a normal 
dumbbell. PB fans state that the PB is better because it is quicker to 
increase the weights(this is a terrible reason to pick the PB over the 
IM). Also I noticed that IM owners tend to be REAL lifters. While PB 
owners many times end up selling their PB dumbbells on craigslist 
because they never use them. I think this says something. If you pick 
this up I suggest picking up some flat black spray cans. They can 
chipped up as you use them. Just give it a quick spray every once in 
awhile to keep the bare metal covered(avoid rust). Off topic, I got the 
IM bench as well. I don’t like it. Almost forgot, you can drop the IM, 
if you drop the PB you will most likely damage them. Of course still try
 to drop the IM in a controlled manner.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-1000"><div id="comment-1000" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 first impression looking at their website reveiwing the Iron Master 
adjustable dumbell weight set was impressive. At first I though I would 
need the 120lb add on kit to realy get some results. Starting off light 
on everything, the amount of weights you get without the 120lb add on is
 enought for almost everything. Operation of the weights is very user 
friendly. People who say it takes too long to adjust the amount of 
weights on the dumbells. For me it is just the right amount of time I 
need to catch my breath anyway, so I think there is no reason to 
announce a problem here. The weights have not made any sounds when using
 them, or coming off. I have full confidence in doing bench press 
excercises with this, or any other excercise moving them over my head. 
The grip that is engraved in the metal feels very good in the hands. As 
well as the overall feel of the weights, very balanced, and a very 
sturdy feel to them. I have not regrets or negative aspects to this 
product for the time being. Shipping took about 2 weeks, and I am 
considering purchasing more products from Iron Master.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-1001"><div id="comment-1001" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 you’re looking to build mass and strength, these are the dumbbells for 
you. If I could rate these out of 10 stars, I would give them a 10/10. 
These are probably my best purchase I’ve made in the last several years,
 besides the gps mount for my dashboard so it doesn’t slide around, but I
 digress. These are American made and world class. This wasn’t a major 
factor in my decision, but definitely worth mentioning. I didn’t get 
these because they’re cheaper then dumbbell racks, or because they don’t
 take up a lot of space, I needed them mainly for portability as I tend 
to move quite a bit. You could load 75lbs on both dumbbells put them on a
 dolly throw the stand on there and move them right along. So what makes
 these the best? I’ll tell you what my number one criteria for 
adjustable dumbbells are, and should be yours too. 1) Do they go heavy 
enough? 2) Are they compact enough for the core exercises? 3) 
Safety/reliability 4) Do they change weight quick enough for all 
exercises? The rest I simply do not care about. These happen to be the 
most aesthetically pleasing dumbbells as well, in my opinion, which is 
just a bonus. So lets discuss my criteria in more detail. 1) They go up 
to 75 lbs, that’s enough for my initial needs. If you need more than 
that to start, you’ll need to get the 120lbs add-on kit. These use the 
quick-lock system as well so you can adjust weight quickly. If that’s 
not enough, and you’re not juicing, then I envy you. You can custom 
order the 165 lbs add-on, however, these do NOT use the quick-lock 
system, as they are full screw in for safety reasons, as explained on 
their website. Do they go heavy enough? 120lbs with quick-lock is more 
than I’ll ever need. You can check out Lee Priest using them on youtube.
 If they’re heavy enough for Lee Priest, the odds are they’re heavy 
enough for you. 2) Are they compact enough? Unlike the bowflex they are 
going to be extremely compact at lower weights, and the most compact at 
heavier weight. This is a big win. You simply don’t want to be doing 
press exercises with bowflex dumbbells, peroid. The powerblocks seem to 
be okay at lower weight, but get exponentially longer as you get heavier
 and heavier. They look like you’re lifting two stereos, I just don’t 
see how you can max them out and do a flat press with them. I’d like to 
know the measurement of the 125 lbs loaded ironmasters vs the 
powerblocks with the same weight. 3) The dumbbells feel incredibly safe.
 I don’t think you can put a price on how these things feel in your 
hands. They don’t rattle or move at all. The only thing I would caution 
people on, is if you put the quick-lock in and forget to turn it to 
“locked” position I could see you scaring yourself, but it would be hard
 to imagine the weights coming completely off unless you held the open 
ended side of the dumbbell completely face down, otherwise you’d surely 
realize you left it open first. Make sure when adjusting weights you 
always check all 4 knobs to make sure they’re locked. Just make a habit 
of it. Maybe this is just me but I don’t want my hand in the powerblock 
cage, it seems like a muscle failure disaster waiting to happen. I read a
 lot of people talk about drop sets, but you shouldn’t be doing drop 
sets, or super sets, or monkey sets or whatever. There’s no need to 
rapidly change weight. If you’re doing flat press and can’t finish the 
set, you need to try again on your next training day until you finish 
the set then up the weight. If you’re hitting a plateau you should do a 
proper “drop” and have a spotter weight assist your press for the last 
few reps. This will help you complete the sets. You don’t want to be 
putting bowflex or powerblocks down to do any “drop sets”. Finish your 
set with a spotter if you’re hitting a wall. If you’re still not getting
 improvements, there’s other reasons like your form, your nutrition, 
etc. Although the ironmasters are the worst in the adjustable dumbbell 
drop set feasibility category, you should see this as an advantage 
because it will prevent you from doing unnecessary drop sets. The only 
time I change weight is when I’m done with warmup sets or I’m moving 
onto a different exercise, and there’s more than enough time during 
rests to do so. I never adjust weight and lift immediately because I’ve 
changed the weight in about 30-45 seconds without any rush so I need to 
continue resting. Another benefit I see people overlooking. You should 
be lifting HEAVY, when you are done with your set, do you really want to
 be trying to line up the powerblocks or the bowflex to get them back on
 their respective stands? No! You want the weight out of your hands as 
quickly as possible, and you can drop them right on their stand, no 
lining up weights, no fuss, you have a smooth flat surface just get them
 on there and free these things from your hands so you can smoothly get 
into your rest. I don’t think ironmasters spotter stands are necessary, 
but you could check them out. Watch Lee Priest is putting them right 
back on the stand when he’s done. That’s what you should be doing. If 
the spotter stands look good to you, there’s also video of Lee using 
them as well. The other key benefit over other adjustables is there is 
perfect weight distribution around the handle. You won’t need to try and
 hold them a certain way when you’re doing curls, etc. If for whatever 
reason you wanted to add more weight to one side of the dumbbell you can
 do that as well. In summary, do you want the dumbbells that allow you 
to quickly and conveniently do exercises like shrugs, curls, bent over 
delt raises etc, or do you want the dumbbells that you can do all those 
exercises with plus maximize your quintessential press exercises! Don’t 
make the same mistake others made. Go with ironmaster and get the 
results you deserve. Plus you get a free t-shirt.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-1002"><div id="comment-1002" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 that these will last a lifetime. The adjustable system in 2.5lb

which is the time between sets anyway. They are a little pricey but you 
really get what you pay for and the price is well worth it when you 
think about this system replacing 10-75lbs of dumbbells in 2.5lb

 admit it–I am a perfectionist.  I research my every purchase to death 
prior to taking the plunge.  I am 58 years and have been working out 
(lifting) for the past 45 years.  I have owned or tried just about every
 type of lifting equipment there is, or ever was.  I wanted a nice set 
of dumbells for use in my smaller home.  The “Ironmaster Quick Lock 
Dumbell System has proven to be the perfect fit for me and my home 
workouts. Design, quality, support, lifetime warranty, and overall 
value.  This is what you get from Ironmaster products.  Forget all the 
other adjustable dumbell systems.  Using the Ironmaster dumbells may 
take a little longer to switch from one weight to another but, it is 
well worth the minimal time difference.  Bowflex, Bayou, PowerBlocks, 
Universal Pak, etc. simply pale in comparison to the Ironmaster. The 
only dumbell system I would own instead of the Ironmaster would be a 
complete set of individual cast dumbells and the appropriate rack (which
 I have owned in the past).  However, having 30 separate dumbells which 
weigh a total of 1,200 lbs takes up a lot of space in one’s home, and 
can become a little cumbersome to move about. Before purchasing a set of
 adjustable dumbells, I urge you to check out the Ironmaster website.  
Still not convinced?  Call them directly–toll free (listed on their 
website).  You will not regret it.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-1004"><div id="comment-1004" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 keep it simple here. 1) NO, they are not “quick change” but if it 
bothers you so much, order another set of handles and load up two sets 
of DB’s to alternate as needed. 2) YES, they are the most solid of the 
major brands out there.  I demo’d PowerBlocks and they just felt weird, 
and the Bowflex/Nautilus stuff will get destroyed in no time.  Check out
 all the plastic parts i them and you’ll know why.  Plus they rattle, 
while the IM’s do not rattle at all so long as you tighten them up. 3) I
 keep a few rubber hex sets in smaller weights around just to avoid the 
changeout routine and keep these heavier.  Maybe that defeats the idea a
 bit, but really, if you’re a guy short of some shoulder exercises, when
 are you gonna be lifting less than 20lbs?  Might as well have a few of 
the small db’s around for those. 4) Company has matching curl bars, 
straight bars, and host of other stuff to compliment the weights once 
you own them.  If space is an issue, they make it easy to keep footprint
 down. 5) These things are the most solid stuff you will find.  They 
will outlive you and if you bore of them, resale is quite high on CL, 
which is where I got mine.

 own both Powerblock Urethane series (Stages 1, 2 and 3, as well as the 
U-125 stand) and I own the Ironmaster dumbbells with the first add-on 
kit (bringing up to a rated..120lbs?). I use and enjoy both systems; 
they’re both different/unique in their own way. The Powerblocks in 
general (it depends) are faster for me to change weights; however the 
IM’s have smaller/more increments compared to the PB’s. Also, life time 
warranty!! Also, the IM’s were HUNDREDS of dollars cheaper than the 
PB’s, and it’s even more apart if you include the price of the 
rack/stand for the PB’s. Things I’ve noticed with the IM’s is trouble 
with locking it at times; also, if you turn the pin to try and lock it 
or w/e, pick the dumbbell(s) up and put it/them back down, the dumbbell 
may loosen some; so try and tighten it again; do as many times until it 
seems like the dumbbell doesn’t budge. Better safe than having a

 started working out with my Ironmaster DBs.  Like other reviewers have 
stated, they are not a “quick lock” system that is well-suited for drop 
sets.  However, for sets with a brief rest between, they function really
 well.  Very solid, very comfortable, easy to use, with a nice stand 
that comes with.  I was surprised to find that the 75 lb set for which I
 paid $535 on Amazon is available for $499 direct from Ironmaster.  
Also, the 120 lb extender set, which goes for $235 from Amazon, is 
available for $215 direct from Ironmaster.  I apparently got too 
comfortable with Amazon and just assumed that ordering from them was the
 way to go.  Turns out that between the 75 lb set and the extender set, I
 paid $56 more than I needed to.  I’ll be doing a lot more comparison 
shopping in the future.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-1007"><div id="comment-1007" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="4">

 wife purchased these directly from Ironmaster in a package as an early 
Father’s Day present. I have owned at one time or another most of the 
major equipment brands at one time or another and Ironmaster is the best
 quality of anything I have ever used. It removed the down time from 
changing weights, now that I have used them several times I can swap 
anywhere from 5-40lbs in seconds. I read one review about it being 
“harder to use then the manufacturer made it look” which simply isn’t 
accurate. I personally found them easier to swap plates faster than the 
Ironmaster website, I can do circuit training almost as fast as 
switching from DB to DB. I also received the super bench with the 
Hypercore, dip attachment, crunch attachment, and the pull-up bar, which
 are all fantastic. I can rip through my routine in about 12-15 minutes 
less then I could beforehand using the traditional threaded DB. The rack
 is very sturdy; it looks flimsy in the pictures, but is very solid and 
has adjustable feet to keep it level. With this setup I can do just 
about anything I wish and has vastly exceeded my expectations from a 
“home gym” I love using them and have no worries or reservations about 
using them like I did with the Bowflex or Powerblocks.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-1009"><div id="comment-1009" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

gym I was working out at, but with a space saving design.  No matter 
what the weight the dumbbells never become cumbersome. The only downside
 I’ve ever read about these dumbbells is the speed in changing weight.  
This is not actually an issue, because both can be fully adjusted from 
10 pounds – whatever in about a minute, and time is required between 
sets anyway.  (The do drop to 5 pounds, but then they are stripped, so 
adding weight is even faster.) They are a little expensive, but are also
 loaded with value, so it’s to be expected.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-1010"><div id="comment-1010" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 you want adjustable dumbbells, a stand, and a system that will almost 
certainly not break if you drop them, look no further. Pros – Weights 
levels are fairly easily changed. – There are no little clinking noises 
when you move the weights (i.e. they are SOLID) – Stand only takes up as
 much space as necessary, not more. – Can go up to 125lbs with the 
expansion – Extremely well built; you will likely have these for 
decades. Cons – Not as easy to change weight levels as the units with 
the switches.  I actually have the bowflex for lighter weights 
(&lt;50lbs) and use these for heavier weights (&gt;60) since I bought 
the expansion set. If you can only afford to have one set of weights, 
don’t need more than 52.5lbs AND don’t think you’ll ever drop them, go 
with the bowflex.  However, if you expect to go above 50 lbs and you 
think that someday you may screw up and drop your weights, you can not 
go wrong with these ironmaster.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-1011"><div id="comment-1011" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 has already been hashed out that these things are the sturdiest 
adjustable dumbbells you can get.  The only problem people have with 
them is that it takes a little longer to change weights which is what I 
want to address.  Each individual screw is much faster than a typical 
dumbbell with a collar, but if you have to change 4 screws every time 
you want to change the weight (2 screws per dumbbell), then that time 
does add up.  This is my solution to problems such as strip sets (not 
100% perfect but I think it works nicely).  Instead of using dumbbells 
that weigh 45, 40, 35, 30 lbs, etc., use dumbbells that weigh 47.5, 
42.5, 37.5, etc.  Make each dumbbell so that 1 side has an extra 2.5-lb 
plate on the inside followed by 5-lb plates.  For example, a 47.5-lb 
dumbbell would have 10 lbs for the handle and screws, one 2.5-lb plate 
close to the middle on one side of the dumbbell, 3 more 5-lb plates on 
that side, and 4 more 5-lb plates on the other side (this shifts the 
center of balance so little you won’t even notice it).  When you’re 
ready to drop the weight by 5-lbs, simply remove a 5-lb plate from the 
side that has 4 5-lb plates on it.  The next time, simply remove a 5-lb 
plate from the other side.  This weigh it should take you half the time 
(or less) to change out weights.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-1012"><div id="comment-1012" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 using a second set of dumbbells, since changing the weights takes a bit

 got the dumbbell / bench combination off the ironmaster website, where 
it is cheaper i believe. here is a combo review, you can skip to the 
part about the weights if not interested in the bench. on the bench you 
need to know if you want to do any decline exercises you’ll need the 
situp attachment for your legs, otherwise it’s just a straight decline 
board and you’ll slip off. however, on the website they’ll have a 
combination for your combination where for less than it would cost to 
get all three you can add: -the situp attachment (good, but the padding 
on the part where your legs comes into contact is a little light, if you
 weigh over 200lbs it is going to be a little uncomfortable if you are 
doing almost upside down exercises (which you can do w/ this bench). i’d
 like to see them improve this or offer more padded pads) -the pullup 
bar attachment (awesome idea, nearly awesome execution. i really like 
it. i’m 6’1″ and if i reach up i can just grasp while almost on my toes 
the top of the bar on its highest setting. if you’re doing really hard 
and swinging pullups / chins you might need to slow down not to wobble 
it excessively but it is clearly sturdy enough to suffice for the job) 
-the dip attachment (i don’t like dips, but if you lay your body against
 the bottom of the bar underneath the bench (actually on the bar 
underneath that supports it, which actually is oddly comfortable) and 
tilt the bench upright a little you can do “australian pullups”, which 
you can’t do any other way so i like this attachment) so the bench is 
awesome. more awesome than i thought or expected and i thought it’d be 
good. i’ve been working out over a decade and a half and played DI 
athletics and find this to be an awesome bench. i can do any exercise at
 whatever angle i want. i slightly decline my dumbbell press and flys, i
 can go upside down (literally) and do triceps like i’m doing tricep 
pulldowns (but in reverse since w/ dumbbells), i can do hanging abs off 
the pullup bar and then go exact opposite and do upside down situps 
(that otherwise would require gravity boots), i can put it at an incline
 and standup and lean against it and do two arm rows to get the back 
(like i was doing a cable row), and anything else you’d normally think 
of or just want to tweak a little to get right in your exercise. plus i 
can do it quick and don’t have some guy (or gal) waiting to use the 
bench. and even more awesome i can just do 30mns whenever i want and if 
i’m tired quit which allows me to be more consistent as opposed to all 
the effort it required to get ready, go to the gym, use my locker, and 
reverse all that when i was done which would probably be 30mns just to 
do that and i’d feel like i had to keep going even if i was tired. it’s 
much better to do small lifting consistently (and you’ll dread it less /
 actually enjoy it if you have the time) than long lifting sessions 
inconsistently. so the bench is awesome (it does require a wrench as 
another reviewer mentioned to assemble), i store it in the flat position
 and put it upright in my closet and it goes in just fine. finally the 
“body solid nylon adjustable cable handle” is an awesome addition to the
 bench. if you put a cable handle (the inside of the nylon triangle) on 
each side of the pullup bar or dip bar you can now use a neutral grip to
 do chinups etc. (at first i was disappointed there was no neutral grip 
but this solved that problem and the seam of the handles holds your body
 weight just fine). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Body-Solid-NB59-Adjustable-Handle/dp/B002DHC6PK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=sporting-goods&amp;qid=1295711936&amp;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.amazon.com/Body-Solid-NB59-Adjustable-Handle/dp/B002DHC6PK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=sporting-goods&amp;qid=1295711936&amp;sr=1-1</a>
 the weights are probably 4 stars but they might be just the best option
 you can come up with. i’ve used the power block weights before and 
hated hated them (it is too tight and jams your arm / wrists when you 
are doing exercises, doesn’t feel right). i’ve also used the bowflex 
dumbbells. it was awhile back but here are the pros and cons i remember 
on them compared to these weights bowflex weight pros: -quicker to 
change (using the “dial”) than ironmaster -small footprint and takes up 
less space than ironmaster w/ all its extra plates sitting around 
bowflex weight cons: -can’t throw them around or they will break and be 
unusable -look cheap and plastic looking ironmaster pros: -you can use 
the weights like a “perfect pushup” and do pushups on them (i really 
like this) -they look good and feel good and solid, just like weights in
 the gym -if you get the combo cause you wanted the bench anyway i think
 the added cost of the dumbbells is significantly less than the bowflex 
90lb dumbbells (i think it is about the same w/ the bench for the 
ironmaster 75lb dumbbells as the bowflex 50lb dumbbells) -very durable. 
you can throw these around (even according to manufacturer) and you can 
tell you’ll be ok -very solid system, i have no worry about a plate 
falling on me if i have tightened the weight, the bowflex i could see a 
weight potentially falling on me, maybe just because you don’t get to 
confirm how that system locks ironmaster cons: -takes longer to change 
and it is annoying, i found i just choose similar weights for exercises 
and group together ones that use the same weight to keep it quick. but 
with that and for the other advantages it is bearable i’d still get the 
ironmaster dumbbells over the bowflex dumbbells as the ironmasters excel
 over the bowflex in every aspect (and have some bowflex doesn’t) except
 for change time and you can work around that some. plus other reviewers
 seem to prefer the ironmasters. that’s the info.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-1014"><div id="comment-1014" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 consider myself a very careful shopper. I do my research, shop for the 
best price and make the best purchase. While I didn’t buy this time from
 amazon, I highly recommend both the adjustable dumbbells and the super 
bench with attachments. I’ve had both for one month now and I don’t 
regret the purchase. The look and feel of the equipment is second to 
none as far as consumer adjustable dumbbells and FID benches go. I no 
longer dread my fitness routine. No more getting ready to go to the gym,
 just pull the bench out and go to town. With the combination I 
purchased, I’m able to perform a full body workout all week and feel 
like I went to the gym. The equipment is that sturdy. After experiencing
 ironmaster equipment, I can’t see myself using anything else at home.

 than cheap spinlocks with regular plates. They are faster to change but
 not that much faster, its the same basic principle with the fancy 
Quicklock system. If you have the money go for it. But a lot of people 
get seduced by the idea of adjustables, esp the crappy Bowflex 
Selecttech. Then they find out about the real alternatives – Ironmaster

 a quick review. If you’re doing the P90X training, this is not for you 
and stop reading this.  If you are doing real weight training these are 
it or have 5-20 seconds between exercises this are for you.  Below, I 
put to rest everyone’s complaints about this product. Let me clear some 
misconceptions  of the product.  The changing of the weights, if you 
follow the directions it can be done in seconds, a maximum of 10-20.  
Turn the lock to line up marks on the dumbbell handle and pull straight 
out.  If you don’t have Parkinson this should be easily done.  When 
locking the dumbbell, turn the lock so it stops, plus a tiny bit.  The 
plates sticking together sounds like user error, I have yet to have this
 issue.  THE VIDEO ON THIS PRODUCT IS FUNNY.  The guy complains about 
the stand and the dumbbells fitting.  Here is the solution, put the 
dumbbells on the other way.  Look at the picture of the stand now…..  Do
 you notice that the dumbbells are on the stand with the ends facing the
 out toward the open edge of the stand.  Well turn the dumbbells, so the
 ends are facing towards the raised side of the stand.  Now, you have 
plenty of room and changing the weights well be easier.  No, the lip of 
the stand doesn’t get in the way.  I think this issue is fault of the 
marketing department and putting the logo of the stand in plain view 
with the end of the dumbbells.  This product is heavy duty and comes 
with a lifetime warranty.  The complaints on this product are very minor
 issues, if you want a real dumbbell feel this is it.  This is the 
cheapest HIGH QUALITY adjustable dumbbell out there, that comes with a 
stand and goes up to 75lbs.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-1020"><div id="comment-1020" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 spent a month researching adjustable dumbbells and finally decided on 
Ironmaster.  I’m really glad I didn’t buy Bowflex SelectTech (it seems 
like every bodybuilding forum hates these). Why I went with Ironmaster 
dumbbells: 1). AUTHENTICITY — These dumbbells are just like the real 
thing. They don’t rattle; there’s no odd parts; you can drop them; they 
are safe and secure. 2). LONGEVITY — There’s a reason these dumbbells 
have a lifetime warranty. No pins, no plastic, and no weak parts. Your 
children’s children could be using these. If you ever decide to you want
 to get rid of them, they have a huge resell value. Throw up an ad on 
Craigslist and recoup ~70% of your purchase price. 3). UPGRADABLE — An 
add-on kit increases the weight to 120lbs. There’s also a “custom” 165lb
 kit. Ironmaster has several other add-ons: kettlebell kit, straightbar 
kit, and EZ curl kit, all which use the same weighted plates. This makes
 these dumbbells a great investment. Ironmaster is located in 
Woodinville, WA, so the closer you live to the Pacific Northwest, the 
faster you’ll receive these dumbbells.  I live in Seattle and ordered 
them Friday morning and received them Saturday afternoon!</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-1024"><div id="comment-1024" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 have compared many adjustable dumbells. Powerblocks, Bowflex 
selecttechs, golds gym, titanweights, ironman lever lock, probell or 
xvest. I found out one thing after looking at all these designs. You can
 have quick change but not without changing the physical look or design 
of the dumbbell. If the quick change is sacrificed to *some* extent, you
 will have  a near perfect dumbell which is IronMaster dumbbell. 
powerblocks, titanweights are a snap in changing the weights but both 
have kind of boxed design. Bowflex, goldsgym, probell, ironman suffer 
from rattling. Besides both the above category dumbbells are not 100% 
suited for some exercises or atleast scare the users that something may 
fall off or hurt them ( bench presses, skull crushers etc ). Ironmaster 
dumbbells are the only ones which feel 1000% ( not a typo) safe in any 
traditional dumbbells exercises. BUT only serious caveat is that 
changing weight does take some time as the weight plates come in 5 
pounds. If you have to change from 20 pound dumbbell to 55 pound 
dumbell, you have to do some math like 55-20 = 35/5 = 7. so need to add 7
 five pound plates to one dumbell. This you need to do it such a way 
that 4 go on one side and 3 on the other side of a dumbbell. Since you 
have to change two dumbells for any exercise, you have to add 4 plates 
on to one side and 3 on the other side for another dumbbell too. This 
sounds very slow but it isnt. still it is much slow compared to changing
 weights on any of the above mentioned dumbbells. But once you change 
the weight and have the dumbbells ready, they are BOMB proof. They dont 
 rattle, dont restrict any movement, can place them sideways ( which you
 cant do with some of the other dumbbells ) on your thigh, drop them on 
floor, dont need to place the dumbbells on a specific platform and have 
to put down somewhere to switch between hands etc. Bottom line is for a 
little sacrifice in changing time, you get tons of other advantages and 
these are AS CLOSE to the traditional dumbbells as you can possible get.
 Finally price wise, they are very competitive ( cheap ) and combined 
with their super bench which is REALLY THE BEST WEIGHT BENCH out there, 
you cannot possibly go wrong. They have a LIFE time warranty on their 
dumbbells which come with a stand/rack included. For super heavy lifters
 ironmasters are expandable to 120 pounds per hand and beyond, I guess 
160 pounds or something. Finally, they are cheaper on their home page 
than amazon (sorry amazon).</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-1025"><div id="comment-1025" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 have had these dumbbells for 6 months now and they are fabulous. I 
really like the small footprint they take, the solid, secure feel they 
have, the ease of adjusting them, and that I can use them like real 
dumbbells if I want to hold on to the side for tricept exercises. The 
screws lock the plates in very well, they don’t take long to adjust, and
 feel like normal dumbbells. I looked at several of the adjustable 
weight systems and this just had the right price and quality match. Plus
 you can use these weights in their kettlebells as well. The black paint
 can chip if you bump one against another, but I am not seeing any 
rusting or other issues with that beyond some very minimal paint chip on
 a few plates. Their products are very good quality and I am mindful of 
them when I look to expand my home gym.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-1027"><div id="comment-1027" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 purchased the Ironmaster 75lb dumbells a few weeks ago, and I gotta say
 they are great.  Not as quick to adjust the weights as the bowflex, but
 they seem to be as sturdy as the gym quality fixed weight dumbells that
 I used to use at the gym.  I would recommend these to anyone over the 
bowflex or any other adjustable system.  Even though it takes a little 
longer to change the weights, it’s still not long enough for it to be an
 issue, maybe 30-40 seconds for both dumbells.  I never write reviews on
 items that I purchase…  my wife does, but I don’t :)…  but I thought 
that the quality was amazing on this item.  I went back and forth 
between purchasing the bowflex and this, and i’m glad I chose this.  
Anyone looking for a great quality adjustable dumbell should look at the
 ironmaster, you won’t be disappointed!</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-1028"><div id="comment-1028" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 did a lot of research for an adjustable set of dumbbells.  What made me
 decide upon the Iron Master set is the quality (having no plastic), the
 gym feel of the handles, the flexibility with the choice of weight 
(able to do 2.5lb changes), and the locking system (the sense of 
security that the weights were not going to fall off during workouts).  I
 wasn’t sure on how easy it would be to change the weights, but it 
really is as easy as described.  I didn’t know it at the time, but Iron 
Master will also sell the handles and locks separately.  So now my 
spouse and I can work out together at the same time, thus eliminating 
the need to constantly change between our sets.  I wish we had bought 
the Super Bench when we bought the dumbbells.  I wasn’t prepared for 
spending that much upfront, but the bench will be our next purchase 
soon.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-1029"><div id="comment-1029" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 fiance and have just begun a workout program. We decided to add 
dumbbells to our inventory. Adjustables were pretty much required since 
we lift different weights. The obvious set that came to mind were the 
bowflex (good marketing on their part). Did some research and read the 
various complaints. Then found the PowerBlocks and was just about sold. 
In fact, I am confident that had we purchased the PowerBlocks, we would 
have been happy. They are more than adequate for what we need right now.
 Read another review that mentioned the ironmasters. Had never heard of 
them. The more I read, the more I liked what I was seeing. It was hard 
to find a legitimate bad review on them. I was pretty much decided on 
getting them and the superbench. I completely lucked out and found a 
local person selling the dumbbells used. I picked up the dumbbell set 
and the add-on kit for less than I could have gotten the dumbbells by 
themselves from ironmaster. Needless to say, I am thankful that we 
scored. The one thing I read and believe is that the weight of the 
PowerBlocks can be changed quicker than on the ironmaster. This is not a
 huge factor for me when I use the dumbbells by myself. If we do workout
 together, the workout takes longer because we are swapping weights. It 
is still relatively quick and very painless. If we need to speed up our 
workouts, I will buy another set of handles so we can both use a set at 
one time. Another factor to consider is all the additional accessories 
available from ironmaster. Once you have the weights, you can get other 
items that utilize the same weights so you do not have to go out and by 
additional weights. This was influential for us because we can expand 
our equipment to match our needs as they arise. Ultimately, I am very 
satisfied with my purchase, especially for the deal I got. I am planning
 on ordering the superbench in the next few days.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-1030"><div id="comment-1030" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 finally got my adjustable DB’s and Super Bench in the mail and I put it
 together. It took me about 2hrs to complete, nothing advanced or 
special tools to put together. I put my weigths together, yet another 
simple task. After school I turned on the TV and to get a feel for it 
and I did some Standard Bench, Incline bench, sitting Tri-extensions and
 lying tri-extensions. The bench is incredibly comfortable and I think 
it is as good as anything you will find in the gym. After securing the 
weights theres no fear of them falling, they don’t rattle or anything. 
Adjusting the bench only requires pressing down on the lever and 
changing it to what angle you want. No problems here either. Bench is 
stable and the fact the weights are square and flat is nice so i can use
 my legs to brace the weigths and thrust upwards. Afterwards I started 
my sitting tri-extensions. No problems getting the diamond hold and 
putting the weight behind my head and working it. The only downside I 
have is I think the plates you should be able to put on in any direction
 and not just the side where they interlock and both side should be 
interlockable. Other than that, i’m glad I bought this set and I would 
do it again. I would recommend getting the dip and cruch add-on, I will 
next pay check. All in All, very high quality. 5-120lb(add-on) is 
excellent range of weight to work out with. This is a great system worth
 investing in long-term.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-1032"><div id="comment-1032" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="4">

 years of collecting the old standard hex dumbells, and trying to 
maintain a home gym in the city in various apartments (usually in the 
common basement) I found the PowerBlock dumbells.  For someone without a
 dedicated room (with lots of space) for their workout equipment, these 
are fantastic dumbells.  They go up to 85 or 90lbs without the add-on 
kit, and they are super fast and easy to change the weight. They are 
pricey, but considering the amount of dumbells they replace, well worth 
it, for the right user. After using the PowerBlock setup for a couple 
years I came across IronMaster, another brand with adjustable dumbells. 
 They go to 75lbs without the add-on kit, and cost a little less than 
the PowerBlock dumbells.  I have BOTH in my home gym now, and I will go 
over the pros and cons of each for those of you trying to decide on a 
set up like this. PowerBlocks: Pros: Well made, comfortable grip, fast 
and easy to change the weight in 10lb increments, nice stand included, 
made in USA, ability to go up to 85-90lbs as is, and 120lbs with add-on.
 Excellent for exercises where you change weight quickly or frequently. 
Square dumbells don’t roll. Cons: Funky design with 4 pillars around 
your hand/wrist. It works, but it makes me nervous at higher weights 
that if I were to drop them I could somehow catch my wrist in there and 
hurt myself.  Difficult to quickly switch weights in increments smaller 
than 10lbs.  This is a problem for many exercises.  Although they are 
sturdy, and have never given out on me, they rattle and the plates move a
 little when you use them. Again, they seem sturdy but when doing 
shoulder or bench press it’s a little disconcerting.  You need to make 
sure the magnetic pins are fully inserted and in the right spot or 
disaster could ensue.  The dumbells get long when using a lot of weight 
which can be somewhat awkward for certain exercises. Overall:  These 
dumbells are best for exercises where you change the weight frequently, 
or quickly, and work best for non-press exercises in my experience. The 
add-on kit is a nice option, but the dumbells are already pretty long at
 85-90lbs, so it may be impractical for a lot of exercises.  They were 
the first of their kind, they are still a serious contender in this 
ring. IronMaster: Pros: Well Made. More traditional looking &amp; 
feeling dumbells.  Up to 75lbs as is, and 125lbs with kit.  Not as long 
as PowerBlocks, no awkward pillars to stick your hand in between.  Nice 
stand included.  Great bench and other accessories available (better 
than PowerBlock bench after using both). No rattling or moving of plates
 when in use.  Sturdy and well balanced and made in USA. Excellent for 
press exercises. Just as quick to change the weight in 2.5lb or 5lb 
increments as it is by 10lbs or more. Cons: Takes significantly longer 
to change the weight than PowerBlocks.  For press exercises I find this 
to be less of an issue, but for curls and other quick change exercises 
it’s a bit of a pain.  No locking mechanism for the screw in pins.  This
 has never been an issue, or caused a dumbell to fall apart during use, 
but there’s no locking mechanism (or magnet such as PowerBlocks) just 
friction preventing the pin from unscrewing.  I’m not too worried about 
it, but it has crossed my mind. Overall: These dumbells are best for 
users who use higher weights for press exercises and want the 
traditional look and feel of a dumbell you might find in the gym.  They 
don’t rattle or move, and are very solid.  They also go higher in weight
 than the PowerBlocks with the add-on kit, and cost less.  Not as good 
for users using ligher weight and requiring quick changes. Conclusion:  
For me, having both pairs is a pretty good set up, but If I were to 
choose just one, I would stick with the IronMaster.  I like them for 
their sturdiness and lack of rattling especially when using heavy 
weight.  In addition to the IronMaster, I would buy a cheaper set of 
adjustable dumbells with a lower maximum weight (50lbs maybe) that could
 be easily adjusted in 5lb (or smaller) increments to use for curls and 
kickbacks etc…and stick with the IronMaster for the heavier weights, 
where I really don’t mind the extra minute of rest to change the weight!
 In fact, I think I will sell my PowerBlocks and get a set up like this,
 and have some money left over for Muscle Milk! 🙂 P.S. the IronMaster 
adjustable bench is the BEST I have used!</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-1033"><div id="comment-1033" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="3">

 Quicklock system is very clever, on paper. You add plates, or take them
 off, and then lock in place by rotating the pins until they stick. For 
someone who would otherwise need a lot of dumbbells, this is really 
convenient. Unfortunately, the poor quality of the plates make it 
extremely time consuming to use. I like to do circuit training and to 
move fast between exercises with no rest. Let me tell you, if you try to
 use this system in a hurry you may get injured. I did. This is because 
the plates don’t really match, and as they switch position when you 
lift, the lock may come undone, unless you are super super careful. Not a
 very safe proposition. I bought this system because of the raving 
review. I guess I am the unlucky one who got poorly made plate, or maybe
 other reviewers don’t mind spending 3 minutes switching plates 
every-single-time. I do. I still use this system, but I ended up buying a
 gym membership because I find it less time consuming and frustrating 
than using this system. If you don’t mind a forced ‘rest’ between 
exercises, this is for you. Too bad: it’s a great idea, and I would have
 given it 5 stars if it wasn’t for the poor quality of the plates.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-1034"><div id="comment-1034" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 went to my local Sears and tried out the Bowflex SelectTechs; then I 
tried out the PowerBlocks that a friend owns. I Came across the 
Ironmaster Quick Lock system after researching adjustable dumbells 
online; I heard the Ironmaster name mentioned in a bodybuilding chat 
forum wherein the original poster had mentioned SelectTechs versus 
PowerBlocks, and one of the replies mentioned that the Ironmaster was 
best. I looked at the Ironmasters online, and they are aware that people
 rarely have a chance to “try before you buy”, so they created a very 
favorable 30-day return policy as a trial period. Impressed by their 
confidence in their product along with my own research, I decided to 
give the Ironmasters a try. To make this brief: This is one of the best 
fitness products I have ever used. I bought the Quick-Lock Dumbell 
system along with the Super Bench, and the 120lb add-on kit (each DB 
goes up to 120lbs), the total with shipping and everything was just 
under $1000. If you buy direct from the IronMaster website, there are 
usually combo deals available that lower the price of buying items 
individually. Having these dumbells is as good as having a complete rack
 of dumbells that go from 10lbs to 120lbs in 5lb increments; but they 
only take up a few square feet of space! They are not as quick to change
 as SelectTech or PowerBlock, but they are reasonably quick &amp; easy 
to change. These dumbells are tough, and like a fixed dumbell at a gym, 
they don’t rattle or have plates sliding around and are FAR and AWAY 
more strongly built than the competitors. You could actually drop these 
on the floor at the end of a set and they are more than tough enough to 
handle the punishment. Unlike the others, Ironmaster INCLUDES the stand 
with the dumbells. The others sell their stands separately for an extra 
$150-$300… keep that in mind when comparing dumbells. Also remember that
 the Ironmasters have a lifetime warranty and are 100% metal, no plastic
 or rubber parts, strictly iron! Please do your research, and I think 
you will agree that the Ironmasters are the best bang for the buck. I 
have been using them for 3 months now and it is one of the best things I
 have ever purchased. They have exceeded my expectations (and that is 
quite rare).</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-1037"><div id="comment-1037" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 75lb dumbells surpassed my expectations.  At$500 I was expecting allot 
and I got it. They are extremely well made, solid, heavy, clean and 
ready to be used by men and women. They start out being 5lbs each just 
the handles and they come with 5lb plates and a couple of 2.5lb plates. 
 For the most part you go from 5lbs unplated up to 75lbs plated for each
 dumbell.  It is a simple locking screw in each end making it very safe.
  It has a little “v” groove to show you how to place/hold the dumbells 
as well as making sure the groove in the end screws match the same 
location which is “locked” in postion so you have no worries of plates 
falling off. They are tight fits so the wgts are very tight together and
 provide little plate clanks when using them similar to what is in many 
gym plated type dumbells. These are NOT the type that have a “switch” 
which changes the wgt.  You phyically have to unscrew and add or remove 
wgt, however, that is very simple and quick.  I have read where one 
complained of such, but it is actually your rest btwn sets and you are 
ready to roll.  However, if that is a concern, do not get these as it 
will require wgt changes as you go. I had road tested some of the switch
 type and was NOT as impressed as I was with these.  Several of the 
switch type at 75lbs were oversized and limited your range of motion.  
These do NOT limit your range as they are about the same size as round 
plated dumbells as some gyms.  These dumbells are square in shape but 
work flawlessly.  The only thing better might be to have pre-set hex 
dumbells on a rack by each 5lb increment.  If you have the space and the
 $1,000 plus you’ll need for many dumbells and rack then look into it.  
If space is an issue, these should be considered. Lastly they come with a
 very sturdy steel stand that is rubber coated on all flat surfaces.  
The top shelf is where the dumbells are stored and a good starting point
 when doing standing exercises and the shelves below can hold the extra 
wgt plated and other fitness items giving you a rack and storage all in 
one and able to fit it all in a small out of the way space. They offer 
an additional set of plates for separate purchase that brings each 
dumbell up to 120lbs each.  The company offering these gives free ground
 shipping and no sales tax so it’s a good deal and provides me with the 
ability to workout on my schedule completely and all with miminal 
apartment space and no need for a gym membership.  However, I do belong 
to one but these will allow for the many days of a tight schedule that 
wouldn’t allow for a trip to the gym.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-1039"><div id="comment-1039" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

 quite a while I was interested in the Bowflex adjustable dumbbells, but
 I’m really glad I found out about the Ironmaster’s set before I made my
 decision to buy such a product. The Bowflex set allows you to lift with
 up to 52.5 pounds per dumbbell, which is fine for those who don’t do 
heavy chest and shoulder presses, or heavy dumbbell rows; but for those 
who really want to push themselves hard, there is nothing like the 
Ironmaster product, since it allows one to lift up to 120 lbs per 
dumbbell with the add-on kit. And although adding and removing plates 
might not be as fast as with other sets, the quick-lock set is extremely
 safe to use. 52.5 pounds per dumbbell would be just about enough for 
some of us to do chest warm-ups. On the other hand, for those really 
interested in working out hard at their own home gyms, there is no 
better choice for a set of adjustable dumbbells than the one offered by 
Ironmaster. I highly recommend this product.</p><p><em>Posted on Amazon.com</em></p></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-1040"><div id="comment-1040" class="comment_container"><div class="img-thumbnail"><img alt="" src="dumbbells_files/a.jpeg" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" class="avatar avatar-80 photo avatar-default" width="80" height="80"></div><div class="comment-text"><div class="star-rating" title="" data-original-title="5">

company and their resellers has been an awesome experience. The design 
of the dumbbells is very strong, so you do not have to worry about 
dropping the weights. I have the smallest room in my house, and I can 
get a good work out in about a 4X6 foot area of floor. Additionally, I 
have somewhat small hands, and the knurled grips are both the right size
 and texture for a secure grip while lifting. Because the plates stack 
together, if you have to move the set, it is very easy and efficient, 
simply stack them together and tape the stack. The Bowflex/Nautilus 
dumbbells are the only other ones I have tried, and weakness of the 
mechanism meant a plate slid out and landed on my foot. DO NOT USE 
BOWFLEX.

 adjustable dumbbells are awesome.  I did a lot of searching when

the Bowflex Selectechs.  These are so far superior than all of those, 
there’s no comparison. The Bowflex Selectechs just felt plain cheap.  
They are not tight and rattle when you’re lifting.  They have cheap 
plastic parts and I just did not feel safe even lifting them over my 
head.  The have the feel of cheap mass-produced made-in-China […].  
These Ironmasters tighten up very snug when you screw the locking pin 
in.  No rattle whatsoever.  They feel as tight as the fixed dumbbells at
 the gym. The only thing the Selectech has over the Ironmaster is that 
you can change the amount of the weight faster (although it’s still 
pretty easy with the Ironmasters).  The Ironmaster is so much better 
constructed, however, that it’s still the easy choice.  Very high 
quality construction.  Plus, they throw in the storage shelf along with 
the dumbbells.

AK, HI and Canadian customers can see the shipping options during checkout. For other International locations, please contact us via email or phone and we can give you a shipping quote.\r\nThe 75 lb Set includes a pair of adjustable dumbbells and the Dumbbell Stand\r\nThe Ironmaster 75 LB Quick-Lock Dumbbell Set is one of our flagship products and a customer favorite for people looking for premium quality adjustable dumbbells. Our latest generation of this product includes our patented quick lock technology allowing you to adjust the weight of each dumbbell from 5 to 75lbs in 2.5 LB increments in less than 15 seconds! The system also includes the dumbbell stand.\r\nUnparalleled Quality and Realistic Feeling Adjustable Dumbbells\r\nMany adjustable dumbbells suffer from the same set of problems and annoyances. They are cheaply made causing them to break or become non-functioning after a short period of time. Not only is this expensive, it can also be extremely dangerous. People have reported competitors products releasing plates from the dumbbell and causing significant injuries. With Ironmaster, you do not have to worry about this. Our products are guaranteed for life with a no-frills lifetime warranty. Another common complaint of competitor products is that the dumbbells do not feel like a real dumbbell. Our adjustable dumbbells look, feel, and function just like real dumbbells. They are solid and ready to go containing no plastic or fragile components.

I have the Power Block Elites as well, and these feel 100x better. I even like them better than my Goodlife gym dumb bells. They look way better in real life than in pictures. Easily Worth the money even if it costed more. Definitely get the 120 set for easier change out(especially if you can lift over 80 easily). \r\n\r\nI live In Canada so it was a pain to get these. Especially during the pandemic. I did a ton of research, and bought these things without ever touching them. Pretty sure its the best investment I've made. I'm very glad I spent the time and money  to get these, they make me excited to work out and it has been keeping me in routine 5 days a week.  And they are just a beauty to look at, seriously.

So quick and easy to adjust. I also have the 120 and 165 add-on kits and it takes up so little space it's funny.

I cannot recommend them highly enough!","datePublished":"2020-06-17T12:50:23-07:00"},{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"joal81"},"reviewBody":"Best adjustable dumbbells that I have ever used. They lock up real solid with absolutely no rattle. I use the time changing the weight as a rest interval and then jump right into my next set or exercise. I recommend purchasing the 120 lbs add on kit since the 22.5 lb weights are much quicker to add than multiple 5 lb plate. Combine these with the Ironmaster Quick-Lock Adjustable Kettlebells and a bench and that is all you need for a home gym.","datePublished":"2020-05-19T18:58:13-07:00"},{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"USMC 0341"},"reviewBody":"These dumbbells are excellent quality and design. They are the correct size handle, excellent grip, and it is easy to change weights. I have lifted for several years and had a large set of dumbbells in my first garage gym. In my new garage gym, I wanted to go with adjustable dumbbells for space, but I was concerned about quality, ease of use, and comfort. These dumbbells exceeded my expectations and feel excellent for performing all exercises. Some adjustable weights are too large (long handles) that are awkward and do not feel like dumbbells. Also, unlike other adjustable dumbbells, they are comfortable while resting on your legs (setup) for doing bench press, shoulder, press, seated curls, etc. The included stand is perfect, and I will be purchasing the curl bar when back in stock. I am sure like you, I conduct a lot of research before buying anything, in particular when it is expensive. These dumbbells are worth the cost, and you get what you pay for. I highly recommend. I hope this review is helpful.","datePublished":"2020-05-03T01:24:31-07:00"}]}</script> <div id="yith-ywgc"><div class="yith-ywgc-overlay close-on-click"></div><div class="yith-ywgc-popup-wrapper"><div class="yith-ywgc-popup-wrapper-region"><div class="yith-ywgc-popup" data-animation-in="fadeIn" data-animation-out="fadeOut" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; width: auto;"><div class="yith-ywgc-popup-inner"><div class="yith-ywgc-popup-close"></div><div class="yith-ywgc-popup-content-wrapper"></div></div></div></div></div></div> <script type="text/javascript">var c=document.body.className;c=c.replace(/woocommerce-no-js/,'woocommerce-js');document.body.className=c</script> <style>.mfp-bg.ct-woovideo-active{background:#000}</style><!--[if lt IE 10]><link
